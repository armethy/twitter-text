Py integration:
  Travis:
    DONE:
    - added Py support
    - fixed up some build lifecycle items (os, before_install)
    PENDING:
    - integrate shell script into .travis.yml:
      - reasoning: is reduntant
    - Py support not tested
  Py version support (.travis.yml):
    DONE:
    - deprecated 2.6:
      - reasoning: too old
    - added 3.5:
      - reasoning: 
        - current Py3 version in Debian stretch
    - added PyPy3.5:
      - reasoning: saw supported pip command but not corresponding version in CI definition
  Py implementation:
    DONE:
    - merged repos (used --allow-unrelated-histories)
    - removed old conformance submodule:
      - reasoning: 
        - not required anymore; original submodule was forked from twitter_s own conformance suite
    PENDING:
    - examine fork(s) for any missing additions:
      - dryan/twitter-conformance
      - etc. (search github, gitlab)
  Licensing:
    DONE:
    - root maintains original Apache license [DONE]
    - ./py maintains original authors' license
